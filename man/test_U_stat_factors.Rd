\title{Tests the (3x3)-minor constraints of a 2-factor model by the maximum of a high-dimensional U-statistic}
\usage{
test_U_stat_factors(X, nr_minors, N = 5000, E = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix with observed data. The number of columns corresponds to the number of observed variables. 
Each row corresponds to one sample.}

\item{nr_minors}{Integer, number of randomly chosen minors that are tested.}

\item{N}{Integer, computational budget parameter.}

\item{E}{Integer, number of bootstrap iterations.}
}
\value{
Named list with two entries: Test statistic (\code{TSTAT}) and p-value (\code{PVAL}).
}
\description{
This function tests the(3x3)-minor constraints of a given 2-factor model to observed data.
The minors are estimated by considering subsets of the data. The number of subsets as well as
the subsets itself are chosen randomly. Each subset is used to form an unbiased estimate of all minors. 
The test statistic is the maximum of the U-statistic formed by the studentized estimates. 
A Gaussian multiplier bootstrap procedure is used to estimate the limiting distribution of 
the test statistic and to compute the p-value of the test.
