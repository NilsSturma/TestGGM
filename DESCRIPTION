Description: Testing the goodness-of-fit of Gaussian graphical models. Multiple algebraic testing methodologies are implemented as well as the likelihood ratio test using the EM-algorithm. Supports testing all Gaussian latent tree models where the observed variables correspond to the leaves of the tree and the two-factor analysis model.
