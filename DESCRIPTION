Description: Tests the goodness-of-fit of Gaussian latent tree models and the two-factor analysis model. Three algebraic testing methodologies are implemented as well as the likelihood ratio test using the EM-algorithm. Supports all Gaussian latent tree models where the observed variables correspond to the leaves of the tree as well as the factor analysis model.
